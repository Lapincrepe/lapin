				<strong> Tardar Sauce </strong> (April 4, 2012 – May 14, 2019), nicknamed
				<strong> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grumpy_Cat" title="Grumpy" target="_blank">  Grumpy Cat </a> </strong>,
				was an American Internet celebrity cat. She was known for her permanently "grumpy" facial appearance, which was caused by an underbite and feline dwarfism
			</p>
			<p>
				She came to prominence when a photograph of her was posted on September 22, 2012, on social news website Reddit by Bryan Bundesen, the brother of her owner Tabatha Bundesen.
			</p>
			<p>
				"Lolcats" and parodies created from the photograph by Reddit users became popular. She was the subject of a popular Internet meme in which humorously negative, cynical images were made from photographs of her.
